# SponsorBlock Landing

This uses the `gatsby` static site generator.

Install `npm` to start.

Then `cd SponsorBlockSite`.

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Developing

```shell
npm run develop
```

This will start a development server on http://localhost:8000.

Before making a pull request, run `npm run format` to format the code.

### Building

```shell
npm run build
```

This will create a folder called `public`, which will contain a statically generated version of the site that can be easily served with any website or deployment service.

You can then use `npm run serve` to preview the website before deployment.
